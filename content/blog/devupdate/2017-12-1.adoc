=== the team

Several of us were able to meet face-to-face for the first time _ever_ in Hong Kong
at the _also-first-ever_ and definitely-hopefully-first-_annual_ ETC Summit! A big
thank you to the event organizers _and_ to so many wonderful participants from
near and far who made it such a diverse, energetic, and welcoming space. Please note
that recordings of the entire (I think?) summit's presentations can be found
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoiplpzdCjbUvrvXFfMhkoA/videos[here, on youtube].

=== the projects

**emerald-wallet** will release their first https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-wallet/releases/latest[_Release Candidate_ (RC1)] today, including support for BIP39 mnemonic phrase retrieval, connection with Shapeshift, improved loading and notification UI, a landing page, and a big refactoring for style and linting. Supporting the wallet's backend, **emerald-cli** released https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-cli/releases/latest[0.18.0] also with support for BIP39 via JSON-RPC and a few minor bug fixes, and **emerald-rs (Vault)** released `0.17.0` and https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-rs/releases/latest[0.18.0] with support for BIP39 mnemonics and BIP32 key derivation. Finally, if you're a React dev, DAPP dev, or chocolate enthusiast, check out https://github.com/shanejonas/react-box-web3-todo[@shanejonas's React TODO Truffle Box], which can quickly put you within throwing distance of your next most ambitious DAPP project.

**go-ethereum** got an important improvement with a fix for peer total difficulty
calculation, which should fix an issue around a "stalling" issue several users have
reported. We're currently nearing the end of a major refactor/redesign of logging,
and are aiming for a release this week. Until then, feel free to jump in early with
the head tracking fix at https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v4.1.2[prerelease 4.1.2] if the stalling issue has been bothering you. In other news, @whilei and @shanejonas made some experiments in log analysis with geth's forthcoming `mlog` API and Elastic's ELK stack. You can find a walkthrough and configs for that at https://github.com/whilei/geth-ELK[whilei/geth-ELK].

We are extremely grateful to *the many volunteers and members of our community* for
so many creative, thoughtful, and ongoing contributions. I'm not going to embarass
myself by listing too few deserving names.

*For example*, in reponse to https://github.com/ethereumproject/explorer/issues/67[etherhub.io being down], https://github.com/kimisan[@kimisan] has offered to contribute his resources and attention to prepare a standby site and maintain it! Thank you, @kimisan, and thank _you all_.
